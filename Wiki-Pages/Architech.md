# Background

Back around Febuarary 13, 2020, players named SoftballGenius3 "Soft" and BountySlayer_24 "Bounty" decided to create their own server with SoftballGenius as the owner. Bounty has since left the server with Luis replacing Bounty's position as co-owner. Soft is clearly inspired by Cynagen. While building up her server, she has essentially copied what makes Cynagen unique. The following contiains screenshot evidence of this offense.



**Plugins**

Architech has many of the plugins that Cynagen has. It's one thing to have some of the same plugin, but Soft has come on Cynagen multiple times to view the plugins list (which is public).

The server logs when someone does `/plugins` or `/pl` along with if someone has obtained a VIP Shard. This screenshot shows the amount of times she's looked at the plugins page.

Cynagen's plugins list:

I know that this section is relatively petty, but it's still important to point out as she gets mostly everything from Cynagen.

**Plot Shop Concept**

Cynagen has a player plot shop system that allows the for buying of plots and making a shop out of it. Architech also has this.

Cynagen's plot shop:

Architech's plot shop:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Super Weapon Concept**

Cynagen has an end-game weapon called `The Blinding Light of Destiny` (Ripped from AQW). There are multiple steps needed and requires an enormous amounts of materials to make.

Cynagen's requirements:

Architech's reguirements:

As you can probably tell, the items required are basically the exact same. Architect didn't even bother to change the name and the enchant on the `Diamond Token`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Discord Role**

On Cynagen's Discord, we have some collectible roles. Architech likes those, too.

Cynagen's Discord Roles:

Architech Discord Roles:

Architech did not really even bother to change the colors of the roles either.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Server Shop**

Both Cynagen and Architech have a server shop where players can purchse items with real-life currency. Archtich has some of the same items that Cynagen offers. 

Cynagen's Shop:

The items and the prices are the same.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PvP Arena**

Soft has came on with an alt onto Cynagen to get "inspired" by copying Cynagen's PvP arena onto her own server.

Cynagen's PvP arena:

Architech's PvP arena:

Here are some Discord messages showing that Soft was indeed on Cynagen's server and copying the PvP arena:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Buying VIP message**

Cynagen's broadcast message when someone buys VIP:

`broadcast {player} is now a part of the epic gamer squad!`

Architech's broadcast message when someone buys VIP:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20980266/77039481-05ac5100-6984-11ea-8967-5d4741c40f67.png)

You can see that she did not even bother to change the message at all.

Note: I don't have access to their command that gets fired when someone does get VIP to verify. But I'm just going to use her message as evidence.
